# Project 3 Generative Visual

Kayla LaPoure, klapoure2@huskers.unl.edu

## Abstract

Many creation stories have similar undertones, I am curious if AI, machine learning will pick that up. Taking multiple creation stories from a variety of cultures and/ or religions, I plan to create images using text to image generation. I am curious to see what differences the AI sees among each image. I would like to interpolate between each of these creation story visuals to display each of them in an interesting way. I also think it would be interesting to use — to read allowed excerpts of each story to use as sound over the interpolation video of visuals. This project isn’t to sway people one way or another to specific religious spaces, but to recognize the differences and similarities to what people believe about our creation. I think recognizing this and finding the beauty in it even if you don’t inherently believe it would be super cool. 
Include your abstract here. This should be one paragraph clearly describing your concept, method, and results. This should tell us what architecture/approach you used. Also describe your creative goals, and whether you were successful in achieving them. Also could describe future directions.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- move files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
- ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

## Reference

References to any papers, techniques, repositories you used:
- Papers
- Repositories
- Blog posts
